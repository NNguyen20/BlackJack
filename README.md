# Welcome to my blackjack game!

To start off, look at the interface, chips are to the far right of the screen, while player and dealer card scores are to the left of the chips.

You start off with $1000 in cash, the fun thing is you can gamble or choose not to if you're not feeling risky.

In order to play, you can pick an amount to gamble, the amount will be tallied into the center between the hit and stay buttons.

Hit means you want to draw another card to increase your total card value, but becareful. If you go over 21 you lose.

If you play too conservative and the dealer has a higher score than you, you also lose. After you decide to hit, you can also choose to stay

Choosing to stay will maintain your cards value, if this is the case remember, if the dealer scores higher than you but doesn't go over 21, you will lose.

# Future planning

Need to address some bugs:

Sometimes when your value is at 13, and you draw an ace, the ace doesn't always evaluate to 1 in which you bust. Should evaluate to 1 in those cases.

UI needs to be aligned properly.

Tie doesn't always show up. Need to fix

Learn to make chips instead of boxes

Have animations
for shuffling, and drawing.

Add functionality to split

Add function to double your bet

Add function to subtract from your bet
